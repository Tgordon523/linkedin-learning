## Correlation

Measure linear correlation between variables. 

Pandas <code>corr</code> function can be used to measure the linear correlation on a scale between -1 or 1. This uses Pearson's correlation coefficient by default.

If the value is greater than 0, it is positively correlated. Positively correlated values increase together which is impacted by how highly correlated the variable may be (how close to 1 is the relationship). This applies to negatively correlated values as well (how close to -1 is the relationship). Remember Correlation != causation
