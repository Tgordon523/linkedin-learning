## Column Reindexing

Reorganizing dataframes by another. 

One dataframe order can be updated to match another with <code> reindex_like </code>.

Column reindexing based on another dataframe is helpful to organize by a template. This can be used to further effect by staking the dataframes on top of each other once properly indexed.
