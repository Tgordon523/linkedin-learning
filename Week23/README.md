## One-Hot Encoding

Create features from categorical values. 

To prepare a categorical column with minimal features for modeling, one option is to use one-hot encoding. Pandas <code>get_dummies</code> function can be used to specify the columns to one hot encode.

One hot encoding is used to create binary columns to be understood in the modeling process. These binary columns are used to indicate the presence or absense of the variable. In this example, whether the teacher was Doug, Karen, or Dwight is now properly documented.
