## Type Annotation 

Python variables are dynamic and can change from one type to another. This can introduce issues into pipelines built if the type changes. 
 
Type Annotation can be implemented easily in Python during function declaration. After each argument,  include a colon and indicate the type.

Type annotation is applicable and useful in all circumstances for a dynamically typed language like Python. They help catch errors, implements more structure to the codebase, and improves readability with clear documentation.
