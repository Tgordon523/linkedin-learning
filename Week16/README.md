## Extract Unstructured Text Part 3

Often, the data we want to use as a feature or analysis can be trapped in a text field.  

There can be multiple groups of text that we want to capture. With a identifiable pattern, we can pass the regex to the <code>extract</code> command to group them accordingly.  

In this example, we are gathering emails within the text. Emails have a specific pattern which can be separated into the username, website, and domain. Regex allows us to extract the defined pattern from the text document.
