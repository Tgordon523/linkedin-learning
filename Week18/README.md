## Column Subsetting 

Columns similar to the values can also be filtered. 

The first example is built-in functionality with <code> loc </code> to slice the data between two columns. For more complex examples, we can create a mask to filter with string methods.

Column subsetting is helpful to use when trying to parse out information from data which isn't tidy. It can also be used to select corresponding feature columns.
