## Pandas Piping

Itâ€™s important to build a pipeline to standardize the workflow of a problem when applicable. The code becomes more readable as a result of the pipeline. If we have defined functions for our data, we can also pass them into the pipe functions. The functions are run in sequential order when executed. 

Pandas requires the use of brackets to pipe functions together. Custom functions can be used with the <code>pipe()</code> function to highlight.

Pipes can be a valuable tool that highlights the specific functions needed to execute a workflow and improve readability overall.
