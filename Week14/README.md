## Type Checking

Python variables are dynamic and can change from one type to another. This can introduce issues into pipelines built if the type changes. 
 
Type checking can be used to validate existing type hinted variables, functions, or classes within a script. Using the mypy library, run mypy script_name.py to evaluate if the script is type safe.  

Type hinting assists with documenting and cleaning up existing code. Type checking expands on the existing type annotations which allows for validation of the inputs and outputs of a script.
