## Pandas Styling

Applying a color mapping or visualization is an important step when working with data. Styling within pandas provides the means to provide CSS to display the data with these highlights.

With Pandas, we can quickly apply a styling of our choice with the dataframe style property. Pre-defined functions like highlight_null are available for standard use and custom functions can also be passed.

This can be useful to validate assumptions on the data or highlight errors. For example given base performance levels, we can highlight all values below this limit to highlight poor performance or possible shortcomings.
